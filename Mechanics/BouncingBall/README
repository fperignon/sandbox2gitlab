Available input files are :

	- BouncingBallTS.cpp: input file using direct C++ description of the model, with TimeStepping.
	- BouncingBallTS.py : python input file (Front-End required)
	- BouncingBallNETS.cpp : using the NewtonEulerDS implementation
	- BouncingBallTS-Scleronomous.cpp : using a  LagrangianScleronomousR Relation defined in the plugin
	
Post-treatment : load 'result.gp' with gnuplot

(gnuplot -persist result.gp)
