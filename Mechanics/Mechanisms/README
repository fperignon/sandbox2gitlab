This directory contains some tests ot the mechanisms toolbox from CAD
Each example directory contains a bodydef.py describing the multibody.

It assumes that both Siconos/Mechanics and Siconos/Front-End have been
configured at the cmake level with -DWITH_MECHANISMS=1 and are installed.

Then, in each directory, the simulation may be executed with this command:

siconos -Psiconos_mechanisms .
